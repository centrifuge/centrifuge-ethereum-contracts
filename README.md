Running it
----------
```bash
# install truffle globally on the machine
npm install -g truffle

# install nodemon globally on the machine
npm install -g nodemon

# install the repo dependencies
npm install 

# run testrpc with fixed mnmonic
npm run testrpc-m

# to run tests
npm run test

# to continuously run tests, if you so choose
npm run re-test
```

*Migrate script will run only all migrations under the 2 prefix, keep that in mind if adding a new prefix contract migration*

Migrate Smart Contracts against Integration Environment
-------------------------------------------------------

Follow instructions under https://github.com/CentrifugeInc/go-centrifuge/blob/master/README.md to deploy a local light node that bootstraps from the remote node.
As soon as the local node is running, and synced:
* Copy `migrateAccount.json` file to your $ETH_DATADIR/$NETWORK_ID/keystore
* Perform migration `./scripts/migrate.sh integration`
  * Unlocks default account
  * Runs truffle migrate
  * Generates environment json file


Migrate Smart Contracts against Rinkeby Environment
---------------------------------------------------

Follow instructions under https://github.com/CentrifugeInc/go-centrifuge/blob/master/README.md to deploy a local light Rinkeby node.
As soon as the local proxy node is running:
* Unlock migrate account:
  * Binary run:
    ```
    geth attach http://localhost:9545 --exec "personal.unlockAccount('0x44a0579754d6c94e7bb2c26bfa7394311cc50ccb', 'INPUT_PWD', 500)"
    ```
  * Docker run:
     ```
     docker run -it --net=host --entrypoint "/geth" centrifugeio/cent-geth:latest attach http://localhost:9545 --exec "personal.unlockAccount('0x44a0579754d6c94e7bb2c26bfa7394311cc50ccb', 'INPUT_PWD', 500)"
     ```
* Perform migration `./scripts/migrate.sh rinkeby`
  * Runs truffle migrate
  * Generates environment json file


Released ABIs + Addresses
-------------------------

We keep track of the released ABIs and their respective deployed addresses as part of the repository.

Every environment will have its own `json` file that contains the following format:
```
{
  "contracts": {
    "ContractName": {
      "abi": ABI map,
      "bytecode": "...",
      "address": "0x94d04e16e8e39b7f6a825689ce52aa60f68069cc"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

We will take advantage of git revision/version control of our smart contracts deployed. 
Master branch always refer to latest, while tags/branches will refer to specific releases.
